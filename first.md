# blog.malt.no

I'm trying out github pages to see if I can get a lightweight blogging 
project going. One of the most facinating things to take into account 
these days is how fast and easy it is to get started with projects. 

Setting up this site and writing the first comments took less than 30 minutes, 
done on a break beteween shores getting the family ready for christmas. 
Pretty nifty.
